# For Users
First, check the [current issues in the frontend folder](https://github.com/Gamified-Gratitude-Journaling/gratitudeJournalingFrontend/issues) to see if your suggestion/bug report has already been reported. 

If there's no duplicate, [Create a new issue in the frontend repository](https://github.com/Gamified-Gratitude-Journaling/gratitudeJournalingFrontend/issues/new). 
Finally, add any relevant labels, E.g. "Bug" to report a bug, or "Enhancement" to suggest a new feature. 

# For Developers
Feel free to try your hand at any of the issues in either the backend or frontend repositories. 
If any frontend developers need a new feature in the API, create a new issue in the backend describing your desired GraphQL Query. 

Alternatively, join our discord server to see if there's anything you want to pitch in.
